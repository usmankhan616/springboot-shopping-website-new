Of course! This is a great idea. A good README file is essential for any project. I've updated your text to reflect the new technologies and deployment setup.

Here is the revised, ready-to-use README. I've focused on updating the database from MySQL to PostgreSQL, and the setup instructions from local to your new Render deployment.

🛒 Spring Boot E-Commerce Shopping Website
A full-stack e-commerce application built with Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, PostgreSQL, Hibernate (JPA), and Bootstrap. This project is deployed live on Render.

Live Demo: https://springboot-shopping-website-new.onrender.com/

🚀 Key Features
🔐 User Roles: Admin & User distinction for managing content.

🛍️ Product Management: Admins can add, update, and delete products.

🗂️ Category Management: Products are organized by categories for easy Browse.

🖼️ Product Image Upload: Simple interface for uploading and displaying product images.

🛒 Session-Based Shopping Cart: A temporary cart for users to add items to during their visit.

👤 User Shopping Flow: A seamless experience for users to add items to their cart, view the cart, and proceed with a simulated checkout.

📊 Admin Dashboard: A central place for administrators to manage products and categories.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring MVC

Database: PostgreSQL (Hosted on Supabase)

Data Access: Hibernate (JPA)

Frontend: Thymeleaf (Server-Side Template Engine)

Styling: Bootstrap

Deployment: Render, Maven (Build Tool)

📁 Project Structure
/src/main/java — Core backend Java source code (controllers, models, services).

/src/main/resources/templates — Thymeleaf HTML files for the user interface.

/src/main/resources/static — Static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

⚙️ Deployment & Setup Instructions
This application is configured for cloud deployment on Render. The database is hosted on Supabase.

Fork/Clone this repository.

Create a PostgreSQL database on a cloud service like Supabase.

Set up a new Web Service on Render and link it to your GitHub repository.

Configure Environment Variables in Render instead of using application.properties for credentials. This is crucial for security and a best practice for cloud deployment.

SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: The JDBC URL for your PostgreSQL database, preferably using a connection pooler URL from Supabase (e.g., jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<db>?sslmode=require).

SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: Your database username (e.g., postgres.project_ref).

SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: Your database password.

server.port: Set this to 10000 or use the ${PORT} variable as recommended by Render.

Deploy! Render will build and run the application using Maven. The live URL will be provided in your Render dashboard.

💼 Admin & User Functionalities
Admin
Add, edit, and delete products from the store.

Create and manage product categories.

View all products sorted by category.

User
Browse and view all available products.

Add desired products to a session-based shopping cart.

View the contents of the cart and proceed through a mock checkout flow.

✅ Future Enhancements
This project serves as a solid foundation and can be extended to include:

User Authentication: Full user registration and login system using Spring Security.

Payment Gateway Integration: Connect to services like Stripe or Razorpay for real transactions.

Order Management: A system for users to view their order history.
